ensors, tweets, emails, web clickstreams, CRM information, supply chain tools . data is flooding into every business, and the businesses that have the most facile processes for divining actionable information from the deluge are going to be the businesses that make the most money.  This data deluge is not just a problem for large enterprises.  Small businesses also interact with their customers using many channels and have websites, databases and often large amounts of other data to analyze.  Hence all the buzz around .big data..  But what does that phrase actually mean, and how does it apply to your business?

The term .big data. is ambiguous . when does it actually cross the line from just being .data.?  The plain truth is that nobody is really sure.  Some people have definitions like .when you have to use tools like machine learning. or .datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage, and analyze..    It can be more useful to define Big Data as the data necessary to make decisions that have a positive impact on a business.  Think about the .bigness. not in terms of literally how much data there is, but in its potential to help make more money.
and thanks for all the fish!
